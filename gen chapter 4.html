        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">2.</span> Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">3.</span> In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord.
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">4.</span> And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering,
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">5.</span> but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">6.</span> Then the Lord said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?

        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">7.</span> If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it."
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">8.</span> Now Cain said to Abel, "Let's go out to the field." And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">9.</span> Then the Lord said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" "I don't know," he replied. "Am I my brother's keeper?"

        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">10.</span> The Lord said, "What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground.

        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">11.</span> Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.

        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">12.</span> When you work the ground, it will no longer yield good crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth."

            <span class="verse-number">13.</span> Cain said to the Lord, "My punishment is more than I can bear.

            <span class="verse-number">14.</span> Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."

        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">15.</span> But the Lord said to him, "Not so; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over." Then the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">16.</span> So Cain went out from the Lord's presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.

        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">21.</span> His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes.

            <span class="verse-number">22.</span> Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah.

        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">23.</span> Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">24.</span> If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times."

        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">25.</span> Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, "God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him."

        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">26.</span> Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to call on the name of the Lord.
