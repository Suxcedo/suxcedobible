            <h1>Genesis 26 (KJV)</h1>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.</span> And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.</span> And the Lord appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.</span> Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4.</span> And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.</span> Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.</span> And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.</span> And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.</span> And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.</span> And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10.</span> And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lain with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11.</span> And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12.</span> Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the Lord blessed him.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13.</span> And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14.</span> For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15.</span> For all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16.</span> And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17.</span> And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18.</span> And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19.</span> And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20.</span> And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21.</span> And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22.</span> And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the Lord hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23.</span> And he went up from thence to Beersheba.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24.</span> And the Lord appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25.</span> And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants digged a well.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26.</span> Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27.</span> And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28.</span> And they said, We saw certainly that the Lord was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29.</span> That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the Lord.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30.</span> And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31.</span> And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32.</span> And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33.</span> And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day.</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34.</span> And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:</div>
            <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35.</span> Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.</div>
