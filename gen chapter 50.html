        <h1>Genesis 50 (KJV)</h1>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.</span> And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.</span> And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.</span> And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4.</span> And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.</span> My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.</span> And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.</span> And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.</span> And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.</span> And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10.</span> And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11.</span> And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond Jordan.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12.</span> And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13.</span> For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14.</span> And Joseph returned into Egypt, he and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15.</span> And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16.</span> And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17.</span> So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18.</span> And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19.</span> And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20.</span> But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21.</span> Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22.</span> And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23.</span> And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24.</span> And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25.</span> And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26.</span> So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</div>
