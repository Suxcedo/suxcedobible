        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.</span> And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.</span> And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.</span> And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4.</span> And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.</span> And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.</span> And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.</span> And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath, the same is Bethlehem.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.</span> And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.</span> And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10.</span> Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11.</span> And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12.</span> And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13.</span> And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14.</span> And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15.</span> And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16.</span> The angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17.</span> And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18.</span> And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19.</span> And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20.</span> And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21.</span> And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22.</span> Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.</div>
