        <h1>Genesis 32 (KJV)</h1>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.</span> And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.</span> And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.</span> And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4.</span> And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.</span> And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.</span> And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.</span> Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.</span> And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.</span> And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the Lord which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10.</span> I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11.</span> Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12.</span> And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13.</span> And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14.</span> Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15.</span> Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16.</span> And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17.</span> And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18.</span> Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19.</span> And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20.</span> And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21.</span> So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22.</span> And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23.</span> And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24.</span> And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25.</span> And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26.</span> And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27.</span> And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28.</span> And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29.</span> And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30.</span> And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31.</span> And as he passed over Peniel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32.</span> Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew that shrank.</div>
